# Manim Machine Learning

Manim Machine Learning is a project focused on providing animations and visualizations of common machine learning concepts with the [Manim Community Library](https://www.manim.community/). We want this project to be a compilation of primitive visualizations that can be easily combined to create videos about complex machine learning concepts. 

## Getting Started 
First you will want to install manim. Then you can run the following to generate the example videos. 

`make video`

or 

`manim -pqh src/vae.py VAEScene`

## Examples

### Variational Autoencoders

This is a visualization of a Variational Autoencoder. You can also find a video form in examples/
